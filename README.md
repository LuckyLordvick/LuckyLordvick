<!--
**LuckyLordvick/LuckyLordvick** is a ‚ú® _special_ ‚ú® repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on creating a no-code app called The Bible Trivia app with the aim of improving a player, typically, a Christian knowledge of the scripture. I currently have 2 levels that are working perfectly; Easy Level and Intermediate Level. Levels of difficulty go up to 6th level, **The Elite Level** which requires a player to have real deep knowledge of Biblical events. Check out the beta version through this link: https://app.jotform.com/bible-trivia-app/bible-trivia-game-2
- üå± I‚Äôm currently enrolled in ALX studying Backend Web Development on a scholarship by the Mastercard Foundation.
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on MERN Stack programming, Front End Web dev, LLM,AI, ML, and Big Data.
- üí¨ Ask me about Christ. LoL. Any day... Anytime.
- üì´ How to reach me: ...
- üòÑ Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I have wanted to learn programming for 10 years now. I just couldn't be able to start due to university, work and I was in the arts industry working as a model/actor/voice-actor. This year I am finally doing it and I am really excited to start my journey in tech and build real apps and software with my own code.
