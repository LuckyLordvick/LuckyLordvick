<h1>Hi, I'm Lucky Lordvick! <br/><a href="https://github.com/LuckyLordvick">Programmer</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in//luckylordvick/">Backend Web Developer</a></h1>

<b>- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating a no-code app called The Bible Trivia app with the aim of improving a player's, typically, a Christian's knowledge of the scripture. I currently have 2 levels of difficulty that are working perfectly; Easy Level and Intermediate Level. Levels of difficulty go up to 6th level ... **The Elite Level**, which requires a player to have really really, really deep knowledge of the Bible. Check out the beta version through this link: https://app.jotform.com/bible-trivia-app/bible-trivia-game-2
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in ALX studying Backend Web Development on a scholarship by the Mastercard Foundation.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on MERN Stack programming, Front End Web dev, LLM, AI, ML, and Big Data.
- 💬 Ask me about Christ. LoL. Any day... Anytime.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have wanted to learn programming for 10 years now. I just couldn't be able to start due to university, work and I was in the arts industry working as a model/actor/voice actor. This year I am finally doing it and I am really excited to start my journey in tech and build real apps and software with my code.</b>
